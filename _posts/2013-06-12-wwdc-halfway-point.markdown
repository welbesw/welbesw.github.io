It's Wednesday of WWDC week and the day’s sessions are over.  It's hard to believe that we are already over half way thru the conference.  At WWDC, the learning flows like drinking from a firehose.  Sessions dealing with the new design and UI changes in iOS 7 seem to be the most popular spots.  Lines now feel like a normal part of every activity... waiting for a session to start, waiting for food, waiting to buy something, restrooms, etc.  It’s actually a pleasant surprise when you find something that doesn’t have a line.  All in all, it’s doable, but the lines do get a bit overwhelming.  This year’s conference is attended by over 60% new attendees.  There’s certainly some veterans here sporting coats from years past, but it’s clear that there are a lot of new faces.  I’m encouraged by the number of young students that are here as well.  Only a couple days left.  I’m hoping to take in several more session and talk to some engineers in the labs on a few topics.  There’s so much on the schedule each day it’s hard to get time to dig into code with the new SDK.
