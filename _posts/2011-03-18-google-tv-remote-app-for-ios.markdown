Looks like Google just released an iOS version of the [remote control app for Google TV](http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/google-tv-remote/id422137859?mt=8).  As a Google TV user, I've been waiting for this to come out.  While others with Android phones have been able to connect to and control my TV with their devices, I've been left in the dark with the iPhone for months now.  I've installed the app but I'll have to wait until I get home in front of my set to give it a run and offer my review.  I was close to breaking out a network sniffer to check out the protocol the Android devices were using and the write my own solution.... but I guess Google has now made that effort pointless.  (I'm glad they did)
