Looking for a way to connect to the Bigcommerce Stores API from iOS or OSX?  I recently developed a [Swift API][github-link] that can be used within iOS and OSX apps.

[BigcommerceApi on Github][github-link]

I've also published the API as a Cocoapod here:

[BigcommerceApi Cocoapod][cocoapod-link]

I created the api and cocoapod as I recently developed and released an administrative app for Bigcommerce store administrators called [Order View][order-view-app-link] on the iOS App Store.
