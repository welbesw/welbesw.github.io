I've ventured down to Chicago for AT&T's mobile [hackathon](http://www.eventbrite.com/event/1896200587) event today.  I'm going to be speaking on iOS and the cloud later this afternoon.  We're meeting at Morningstar in some really nice meeting space - hip, trendy and comfortable.  I'm going to be going over the iOS + Cloud options as well as doing a little demo and deeper dive into the SDK that Microsoft has made available for use with Azure.  I've posted a [sample app](https://github.com/CentareGroup/Centare---iOS-Azure-Samples) to github that I'll be using in the demo.  It's a very simple implementation of the Azure toolkit just to kick the tires and see what it's capable of.
