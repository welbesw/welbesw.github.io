Apple today released a video on their [YouTube channel](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PGtP6ZQ6Lt8) called 'Making a difference.  One app at a time.'  It features several apps that are impacting lives around the world.  As I've been attending sessions at WWDC, I've seen an emphasis on accessibility and the capabilities that are built into iOS.  The video highlights how apps are being used on these platforms to have a huge impact on the daily lives of so many.  It's encouraging to see developers focused on solving so many different things across the globe.
