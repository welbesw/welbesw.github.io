The Wall Street Journal has an [article](http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052970203405504576603053795839250.html) out today that indicates Sprint is essentially betting it's future on the iPhone.  It's been rumored that Sprint will be picking up the new iPhone to be officially announced on Tuesday, but this article provides a lot more insight into what lengths the carriers are going to get the iPhone on their network.  Sprint CEO Dave Hesse indicated that the lack of the iPhone was the number one reason people were choosing to leave Sprint.  We'll see if having the latest iPhone will help keep their current customers and attract millions more.  Sprint is betting on their ability to sell 30.5 million iPhones, Apple's price tag to get in the game, which comes to about $20 billion at current device prices.  See the article for some great details on the deal.
