description: "I've created this blog to act as a scratch pad for stuff I come across as an iOS developer. I spent some time researching what the best platform would be for a development related blog with code postings, nice look and feel, etc. and I finally had to just pick something. I'm familiar with Blogger and I think it will fit the bill for most of the things I'm interested in. I'm going to attempt to incorporate a source code syntax highlighter for easy code posting and viewing."

I've created this blog to act as a scratch pad for stuff I come across as an iOS developer. I spent some time researching what the best platform would be for a development related blog with code postings, nice look and feel, etc. and I finally had to just pick something. I'm familiar with Blogger and I think it will fit the bill for most of the things I'm interested in. I'm going to attempt to incorporate a source code syntax highlighter for easy code posting and viewing.

### UPDATE ### 
December 2013 - I've moved this blog to Github Pages and I am now using Jekyll and Bootstrap 3.  I'm liking the simplicity compared to Blogger.
