HP announced today that they will end operations of it's webOS - the operating system for the HP Touchpad tablet - and cease selling the Touchpad.  Stunning.  The device was released just back in June... about 6 weeks ago.  Earlier reports from retailers such as Best Buy were indicating that sales of the Touchpad were very slow - something like 10% of the stock ordered.

Looks like Apple's hold on the tablet market with the iPad continues to dominate.  I am curious how the Playbook is selling as well as any of the several Android powered tablets.  Who's next to fall?
