Following my presentation on iOS here at [Centare](http://www.centare.com/) last night, my coworker Dean passed along a link to a set of [iPhone stencils for Visio](http://www.beacon16.com/2010/09/the-visio-iphone-stencil/).  In my presentation, I demonstrated some wireframes created in Balsamiq, but clearly Visio would be able to do the job if there was a set of stencils available.  Jonathan Abbett of Beacon 16 created these templates and posted them online for others to use.  This makes it easier for those living in the Windows world to do some rapid wireframing for iOS... to tide them over until they make the plunge into the Apple eco system.
