A coworker of mine passed along an excellent blog posting on an iOS developer's perspective on Android development.  Take a look at Nick Farina's article here: [An iOS Developer Takes on Andriod](http://nfarina.com/post/8239634061/ios-to-android)

Good stuff.  My favorite quote in the article:

>When you’re using an iPhone, you’re playing a hardware-accelerated 3D game. You know, the kind of 3D where everything is made out of hundreds of little triangles.

I sometimes forget that OpenGL is involved in the rendering process of even UIKit.  It allows the platform to include so much slick animation and subtle UI elements in iOS that add up to a really polished user experience.
